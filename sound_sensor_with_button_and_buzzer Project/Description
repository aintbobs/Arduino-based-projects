# 🎤 Arduino Sound Detection Alarm System  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project is a **Sound Detection Alarm System** using Arduino.  
It detects **loud noises** with a sound sensor and triggers a **buzzer alarm** until the user resets it with a button.  

✅ Buzzer stays **OFF** if no loud sound is detected  
🚨 Buzzer turns **ON** if loud sound is detected (above threshold)  
🔘 Alarm can be reset using the **reset button**

## 🔧 Components Used  
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)  
- Sound sensor module (microphone-based)  
- Active buzzer  
- Push button (reset)  
- Breadboard + jumper wires  

---

## ⚡ Features  
- Detects loud sounds (e.g., claps, knocks, voice, noise).  
- Activates **buzzer alarm** when noise exceeds a set threshold.  
- Requires **manual reset button** to stop the alarm.  
- Can be used for **intruder alerts, clap detection, and sound-triggered automation**.

## ▶️ How to Run  
1. Connect the components as follows:  
   - Sound Sensor → **A0**  
   - Buzzer → **D9**  
   - Reset Button → **D2** (with internal pull-up enabled)  

2. Upload the Arduino code.  
3. Make a **loud sound** (clap, knock, or shout) near the sensor.  
4. The **buzzer alarm will turn ON**.  
5. Press the **reset button** to silence the alarm.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Learned  
- How to use a **sound sensor module** with Arduino.  
- Setting **threshold values** for sensor input.  
- Controlling alarms with **digital outputs** (buzzer).  
- Implementing a **manual reset system** with buttons.  
- Designing simple **intruder alert and automation systems**.
