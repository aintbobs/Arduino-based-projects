# RFID Door Lock System with LCD and Servo

## üìå Project Description
This project is an **RFID-based door lock system** using Arduino, an RC522 RFID module, a servo motor, and an LCD.  
When an authorized RFID card is scanned, the servo rotates to unlock or lock the door. The LCD provides feedback messages such as **"Door is open"**, **"Door is locked"**, or **"Wrong card!"**.  

This project demonstrates a simple access control mechanism that can be applied to home security, offices, or lockers.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Replace `"YOUR_AUTHORIZED_CARD_UID"` in the code with the UID of your RFID card (get it from Serial Monitor).  
2. Connect the circuit as shown above.  
3. Upload the code to Arduino.  
4. Scan your RFID card:  
   - If authorized: the servo unlocks/locks the door.  
   - If unauthorized: LCD displays **"Wrong card!"**
