# Arduino Keypad, Relay, and LED Control with LCD

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino with a **4x4 keypad**, **I2C LCD**, **relay module**, **potentiometer**, and **LED**.  

- The **keypad** detects user input and displays the pressed key on the LCD.  
- Pressing `*` activates the relay (ON), pressing `#` deactivates it (OFF).  
- The **potentiometer** controls LED brightness in real-time.  
- The **LCD** shows feedback for keys pressed.  

This simulates a **basic control panel system** that could be extended for home automation.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)  
- 16x2 I2C LCD (address `0x27`)  
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad  
- Relay Module (5V)  
- Potentiometer  
- LED + Resistor  
- Breadboard + Jumper wires

## ⚡ Features
- Displays pressed keys on LCD.  
- Relay control with keypad:  
  - `*` → Relay ON  
  - `#` → Relay OFF  
- Potentiometer adjusts LED brightness (PWM).  
- Real-time visual feedback via LCD.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Wire the components as follows:  
   - LCD via I2C (SDA → A4, SCL → A5).  
   - Keypad rows → D2–D5, cols → D6–D9.  
   - Relay → D10.  
   - LED → D11 (PWM pin).  
   - Potentiometer → A0.  

2. Upload the code to Arduino.  
3. Try pressing keys — LCD will show which one was pressed.  
4. Use potentiometer to adjust LED brightness.  
5. Control relay with `*` (ON) and `#` (OFF).
