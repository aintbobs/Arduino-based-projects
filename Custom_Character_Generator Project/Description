# Arduino LCD Custom Character Generator

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to create and display **custom characters** on a 16x2 I2C LCD using Arduino.  
Instead of just showing standard ASCII text, the LCD is programmed to display pixel-based icons and shapes (e.g., arrows, symbols, faces).  

This is useful for projects that require **visual feedback** beyond regular text, such as indicators, progress bars, or icons.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display (address `0x27`)  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard  

---

## ⚡ Features
- Define multiple custom characters (up to 8 at once).  
- Write them to specific LCD positions.  
- Demonstrates cursor, clear, blink, and backlight functions of the LCD library.  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Connect the I2C LCD to Arduino (SDA → A4, SCL → A5 on Arduino Uno).  
2. Upload the code to your Arduino board.  
3. The LCD will first show a few custom icons, then clear, then display "Custom Character" with multiple symbols.  
4. Cursor and blink functions will toggle as a demo.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Learned
- How to use `lcd.createChar()` to store custom characters in the LCD’s CGRAM.  
- How to control cursor, clear, and blink functions.  
- How to go beyond plain text and add **visual creativity** to LCD projects.
