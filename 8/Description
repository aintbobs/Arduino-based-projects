# Automatic Car Wiper System with Rain Sensor

## üìå Project Description
This project simulates an **automatic car windshield wiper system** using Arduino, a rain sensor, a servo motor, and an LCD display.  
The rain sensor detects the **intensity of rainfall**, and the servo motor moves accordingly to mimic windshield wipers.  
The LCD displays the current rainfall condition: **No Rain, Low, Medium, or High**.  

This project demonstrates how sensor readings can be used to automate mechanical systems, which is widely applied in automotive technology.

## üîß Components Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- Rain Sensor Module  
- Servo Motor (simulates wiper motion)  
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display (address `0x27`)  
- Jumper wires + Breadboard  

---

## ‚ö° Features
- Detects rain intensity using analog sensor values.  
- Controls servo motor speed (wiper speed) depending on rain level.  
- Displays real-time status on LCD:  
  - **No Rain**  
  - **Rain Amount: Low**  
  - **Rain Amount: Medium**  
  - **Rain Amount: High**

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Connect the rain sensor output to Arduino analog pin A0.  
2. Connect the servo motor to pin 9.  
3. Connect the I2C LCD to SDA (A4) and SCL (A5).  
4. Upload the code to Arduino.  
5. Simulate rain (or place water drops on the sensor) and observe the LCD messages and servo movement.
