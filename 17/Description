# 🌧️ Arduino Rain Detection & Alert System

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **Rain Detection & Alert System** using Arduino.  
It uses a **rain sensor** to detect rainfall and alerts the user with a **buzzer** and **LED indicators**.

✅ Green LED = No rain (safe)  
🚨 Red LED + Buzzer = Rain detected (warning)  

---

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)  
- Rain sensor module  
- Active buzzer  
- 2 LEDs (Red & Green) + resistors  
- Breadboard + jumper wires  

---

## ⚡ Features
- Detects rainfall using a rain sensor.  
- Alerts with **sound (buzzer)** and **LED indicators**.  
- Prints real-time rain status on the **Serial Monitor**.  

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Connect the components as follows:  
   - Rain sensor → A0  
   - Buzzer → A2  
   - Red LED → D7  
   - Green LED → D8  

2. Upload the Arduino code.  
3. Open the Serial Monitor at **9600 baud**.  
4. Test by placing drops of water on the rain sensor.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Learned
- How to use a **rain sensor module** with Arduino.  
- Using **digital state change detection** (`prev_state` vs `current_state`).  
- Controlling multiple outputs (buzzer + LEDs) based on sensor input.  
- Designing a simple **alert system** for **weather monitoring / smart home automation**.
