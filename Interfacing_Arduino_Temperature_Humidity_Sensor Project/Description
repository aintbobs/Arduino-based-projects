# Arduino Smart Climate Monitor (DHT11 + LCD + Servo + Buzzer)

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **Smart Climate Monitoring System** using Arduino.  
It measures **temperature and humidity** using a DHT11 sensor, shows the values on an **I2C LCD**, and reacts using **LED indicators**, a **buzzer alarm**, and a **servo motor**.

✅ Green LED = Safe humidity  
⚠️ Yellow LED = Warning (moderate humidity)  
🚨 Red LED + buzzer + servo = Danger (high humidity)  

This setup simulates a **safety system** that could be used in **greenhouses, server rooms, or storage areas** where humidity must be controlled.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)  
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor  
- 16x2 LCD with I2C module  
- Green, Yellow, Red LEDs + resistors  
- Active Buzzer  
- SG90 Servo motor  
- Breadboard + Jumper wires  

---

## ⚡ Features
- Real-time temperature & humidity display on LCD.  
- Multi-level humidity monitoring with LEDs:  
  - `< 28%` → Green (Safe)  
  - `29–60%` → Yellow blinking (Warning)  
  - `≥ 61%` → Red blinking + buzzer + servo moves (Danger)  
- Servo motor simulates automatic response (e.g., opening vents).  
- Buzzer provides audible alarm in danger zone.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Wire the components:  
   - DHT11 → D2  
   - Green LED → D3  
   - Yellow LED → D4  
   - Red LED → D5  
   - Buzzer → D6  
   - Servo → D7  
   - LCD (I2C) → SDA (A4), SCL (A5)  

2. Upload the Arduino code.  
3. Open Serial Monitor (optional) to verify readings.  
4. Observe the LCD, LEDs, buzzer, and servo reacting to humidity levels.
