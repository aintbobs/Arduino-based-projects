# 📏 Arduino Ultrasonic Distance & Alert System  

## 📌 Project Description  
This project is an **Ultrasonic Distance Measurement & Alert System** using Arduino.  
It measures the **distance of objects** using an ultrasonic sensor and provides feedback through:  

- **16x2 I2C LCD Display** (shows distance in cm)  
- **LED indicators** (Green = Safe, Yellow = Warning, Red = Danger)  
- **Buzzer alert** when object is too close  

✅ Green LED = Safe distance  
⚠️ Yellow LED = Caution (object nearby)  
🚨 Red LED + Buzzer = Danger (object too close)

## 🔧 Components Used  
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)  
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)  
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display  
- Active buzzer  
- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) + resistors  
- Breadboard + jumper wires  

---

## ⚡ Features  
- Measures distance using **ultrasonic sound waves**.  
- Real-time **LCD display output**.  
- Multi-level **LED indication system**.  
- **Buzzer alert** when object is within danger range.  
- Can be used for **parking assistance, robotics, and obstacle detection**.

## ▶️ How to Run  
1. Connect the components as follows:  
   - Ultrasonic Sensor → **Trig (D2), Echo (D3)**  
   - Green LED → **D4**  
   - Yellow LED → **D5**  
   - Red LED → **D6**  
   - Buzzer → **D7**  
   - I2C LCD → **SDA (A4), SCL (A5)**  

2. Upload the Arduino code.  
3. Open the Serial Monitor at **9600 baud** (optional).  
4. Place an object in front of the sensor and observe LED, buzzer, and LCD feedback.
