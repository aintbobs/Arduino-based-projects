# Arduino Joystick with LCD

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates how to interface an **analog joystick** with an **I2C LCD** using Arduino.  
The LCD displays the joystick direction (Left, Right, Forward, Backward), and it also detects when the joystick button is pressed.  

This is a simple project that teaches the basics of reading analog input values and displaying real-time feedback on an LCD screen.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- Joystick module (with X, Y axis + push button)  
- I2C 16x2 LCD display (address `0x27`)  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard  

---

## ⚡ Circuit Connections
- Joystick X → A0  
- Joystick Y → A1  
- Joystick SW (button) → D2  
- LCD → I2C (SDA to A4, SCL to A5 on Arduino Uno)  
- VCC → 5V, GND → GND

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Connect the circuit as described above.  
2. Upload the `joystick_lcd.ino` code to your Arduino board.  
3. Move the joystick in different directions → LCD will display `Left`, `Right`, `Forward`, `Backward`.  
4. Press the joystick button → LCD will show `Pressed Button`.
