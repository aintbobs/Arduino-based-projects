# 💧 Arduino Water Level Monitoring System

## 📌 Description
This project is a **Water Tank Monitoring System** using Arduino, a water level sensor, LEDs, a buzzer, and an LCD.  
It measures water level and provides **real-time feedback** through:

- **LCD Display** (Empty, Low, Medium, Full)  
- **LED indicators** (Red, Yellow, Green)  
- **Buzzer Alerts** (empty & full warning)  
- **Serial Monitor logging**

---

## 🔧 Components
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)  
- Water level sensor module  
- 16x2 I2C LCD  
- Buzzer  
- 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) + resistors  
- Breadboard + jumper wires  

---

## 📊 Features
- Monitors water level with analog sensor.  
- Alerts user when tank is **empty** or **full**.  
- Provides **visual indication** with LEDs.  
- LCD shows real-time water status.  
- Can prevent **overflow** and **pump dry-run damage**.

## ⚡ How to Use
1. Connect sensor to **A0**.  
2. LEDs to pins **10, 11, 12**.  
3. Buzzer to pin **9**.  
4. Upload code and open Serial Monitor at **9600 baud**.  
5. Place sensor in water and observe readings.

## 🧑‍💻 Learnings
- Using **analog sensors** with Arduino.  
- Mapping values to thresholds (`LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`).  
- Interfacing **LCD I2C displays**.  
- Implementing **alert systems** with buzzer + LEDs.
